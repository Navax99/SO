getpagesize - get memory page size

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int getpagesize(void);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       getpagesize(): _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500

DESCRIPTION
       The  function getpagesize() returns the number of bytes in a page, where a "page"
       is the thing used where it says in the description  of  mmap(2)  that  files  are
       mapped in page-sized units.

       The size of the kind of pages that mmap(2) uses, is found using
       The  -n  switch  causes the header to be displayed only once rather than periodi‐
       cally.
           #include <unistd.h>
           long sz = sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE);
       The  -n  switch  causes the header to be displayed only once rather than periodi‐
       cally.
       (most systems allow the synonym _SC_PAGE_SIZE for _SC_PAGESIZE), or

           #include <unistd.h>
           int sz = getpagesize();



       free - Display amount of free and used memory in the system

SYNOPSIS
       free [-b | -k | -m | -g] [-o] [-s delay ] [-t] [-V]

DESCRIPTION       The  -n  switch  causes the header to be displayed only once rather than periodi‐
       cally.
       free  displays  the total amount of free and used physical and swap memory in the
       system, as well as the buffers used by the  kernel.   The  shared  memory  column
       should be ignored; it is obsolete.

   Options
       The  -b  switch  displays  the  amount  of memory in bytes; the -k switch (set by
       default) displays it in kilobytes; the -m switch displays it in megabytes; the -g
       switch displays it in gigabytes.


       vmstat - Report virtual memory statistics

SYNOPSIS
       vmstat [-a] [-n] [delay [ count]]
       vmstat [-f] [-s] [-m]
       vmstat [-S unit]
       vmstat [-d]
       vmstat [-D]
       vmstat [-p disk partition]
       vmstat [-V]

DESCRIPTION
       vmstat  reports  information  about  processes,  memory, paging, block IO, traps,
       disks and cpu activity.

       The first report produced gives  averages  since  the  last  reboot.   Additional
       reports  give  information on a sampling period of length delay.  The process and
       memory reports are instantaneous in either case.

       The  -n  switch  causes the header to be displayed only once rather than periodi‐
       cally.


       top - display Linux tasks

SYNOPSIS
       top -hv | -bcHisS -d delay -n iterations -p pid [, pid ...]

       The traditional switches '-' and whitespace are optional.

DESCRIPTION
       The  top  program  provides a dynamic real-time view of a running system.  It can
       display system summary information as well as a list  of  tasks  currently  being
       managed  by  the Linux kernel.  The types of system summary information shown and
       the types, order and size of information displayed for tasks are all user config‐
       urable and that configuration can be made persistent across restarts.

       The  program provides a limited interactive interface for process manipulation as
       well as a much more extensive interface for personal  configuration   --   encom‐
       passing  every  aspect of its operation.  And while top is referred to throughout
       this document, you are free to name the program  anything  you  wish.   That  new
       name,  possibly  an  alias, will then be reflected on top's display and used when
       reading and writing a configuration file.

         <f> and <o> :Fields_select or Order_fields
              These keys display separate screens where you can change which fields  are
              displayed  and  their order.  For additional information on these interac‐
              tive commands see topic 2b. SELECTING and ORDERING Columns.
